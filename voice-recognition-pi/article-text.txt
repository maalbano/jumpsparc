My custom modules

Beep.py
this is a wrapper module that I use to run a bash command, to call a short program i wrote in C/WiringPi that makes a buzzer connected to GPIO pin 26 beep a number of times.

Coffee.py
in this module I use the Python module “requests” to call the published Web API function on my Spark Core to start brewing coffee.

Christmas.py
this is a wrapper module that I use to run a bash command, calling omxplayer (command line media player included in Raspbian)  to play TheFirstNoel.mp3 that I copied to my Pi through netatalk.
